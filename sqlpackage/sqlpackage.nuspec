    <description>SqlPackage.exe is a command-line utility that automates the following database development tasks:
      * Extract: Creates a database snapshot (.dacpac) file from a live SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
      * Publish: Incrementally updates a database schema to match the schema of a source .dacpac file. If the database does not exist on the server, the publish operation creates it. Otherwise, an existing database is updated.
      * Export: Exports a live database - including database schema and user data - from SQL Server or Azure SQL Database to a BACPAC package (.bacpac file).
      * Import: Imports the schema and table data from a BACPAC package into a new user database in an instance of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
      * DeployReport: Creates an XML report of the changes that would be made by a publish action.
      * DriftReport: Creates an XML report of the changes that have been made to a registered database since it was last registered.
      * Script: Creates a Transact-SQL incremental update script that updates the schema of a target to match the schema of a source.</description>
