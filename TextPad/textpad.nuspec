    <releaseNotes>##TextPad 8.7.0 (12-May-2021)##
Enhancements: 

* Implemented an editor for keystroke macros.

Issues resolved:

* The Find Next command ignored the option to wrap searches when the cursor was at the end of file.  
* The Extend Selection Down command did not work if the cursor was previously on a higher line number.  
* A crash when displaying long system time formats in the status bar has been fixed.  
* When the time was displayed on the status bar, it was partially obscured.  
* The Replace All command took too long on files with many lines.  
* Fixed a crash when paging down to the end of a word wrapped document, with critical combination of page size and font.  
* The width of the space character increased, when viewing the properties of a document.  
* The progress bar was not being updated while opening very large files.
